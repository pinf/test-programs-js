Test Programs for the PINF JavaScript Platform
==============================================

**Status: BETA**

**NOTE: This projects initially targets a UNIX toolchain. Windows support is planned.**

This project contains example JavaScript programs conforming to and building
on the [CommonJS](http://commonjs.org/) standards. The programs are made up
of packages loaded via the [PINF JavaScript Loader](https://github.com/pinf/loader-js)
from the [PINF JavaScript Test Packages](https://github.com/pinf/test-packages-js) 
project and other places around the Internet.

The programs require any one or more of the following JavaScript platforms:

  * [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) - Scalable, asynchronous JavaScript network programs (**Currently required at minimum and used by default**)
  * [GPSEE](http://code.google.com/p/gpsee) - General Purpose Spidermonkey Embedding Ecosystem
  * [v8cgi](http://code.google.com/p/v8cgi) - CGI wrapper around V8 JavaScript engine
  * [Narwhal](https://github.com/280north/narwhal) - Cross-platform, multi-interpreter, general purpose JavaScript platform
  * [RingoJS](http://ringojs.org/) - JavaScript runtime based on Mozilla Rhino (Java)
  * Modern Browser

Platform install instructions:

  * See individual platform projects
  * [PINF JavaScript Platform for OSX Lion](https://github.com/pinf/platform-js/blob/master/docs/osx-lion.md) (includes all supported platforms)

You also need the [PINF JavaScript Loader](https://github.com/pinf/loader-js). Use
any one of the following install solutions:

    npm install -g pinf-loader-js

    cd ~/
    wget -O pinf-loader-js.tar.gz https://github.com/pinf/loader-js/tarball/master
    tar -zxf pinf-loader-js.tar.gz
    mv pinf-loader-js-* pinf-loader-js
    alias commonjs='~/pinf-loader-js/pinf-loader.sh'

    cd ~/
    git clone git://github.com/pinf/loader-js.git pinf-loader-js
    alias commonjs='~/pinf-loader-js/pinf-loader.sh'

Make sure it works:

    commonjs -h

*NOTE: When running the programs below a `.pinf_packages` folder is created in your current
working directory which holds the downloaded dependencies. To keep dependencies centrally
create a folder at `/pinf/pinf_packages`.*


Test/Example Programs
=====================

CONTRIBUTE: If any of the programs below do not work on the indicated platforms on your system please 
[let us know](http://groups.google.com/group/pinf-dev/)! You can also help complete the
[API adapters](https://github.com/pinf/loader-js/tree/master/lib/pinf-loader-js/adapter) to bring full
support to all platforms (where possible).

Portable
--------

Programs that run on all platforms (command-line and in-browser):

  * `HelloWorld` - A bare-bones Hello World with a dependency. See [./HelloWorld](https://github.com/pinf/test-programs-js/tree/master/HelloWorld)
  * `AdditionalLoad` - Additional code loading with a dependency. See [./AdditionalLoad](https://github.com/pinf/test-programs-js/tree/master/AdditionalLoad)
  * `JSLintBenchmark` - JSLint Benchmark. See [./JSLintBenchmark](https://github.com/pinf/test-programs-js/tree/master/JSLintBenchmark)
  * `ModuleSourceFormats` - Module Source Formats. See [./ModuleSourceFormats](https://github.com/pinf/test-programs-js/tree/master/ModuleSourceFormats)

Run the programs via the Demo Program Runner included in this project:

    commonjs -v --platform node https://github.com/pinf/test-programs-js/zipball/master --port 8081 HelloWorld

This will run the program once on the **command line**, export it for **static serving** and start a development
server that will **dynamically load the program into a browser** with every refresh.

To run the programs (in command-line mode) on various platforms (without the browser stuff) use:

    commonjs -v --platform <PlatformAlias> https://github.com/pinf/test-programs-js/zipball/master HelloWorld

Where `<PlatformAlias>` is any of `node`, `gpsee`, `v8cgi`, `narwhal` or `ringo`.

Drop the `-v` to omit the loader progress output.

**NOTE: Currently requires running with `--platform node` (default) ONCE first to download dependencies due to incomplete 
[API adapters](https://github.com/pinf/loader-js/tree/master/lib/pinf-loader-js/adapter) for the other platforms.**


Platform: `node`
----------------

Programs leveraging the `node` platform:

  * Simple command-line URL Fetcher. See [./URLFetcher](https://github.com/pinf/test-programs-js/tree/master/URLFetcher) 
    (*Will run on all platforms once [API adapters](https://github.com/pinf/loader-js/tree/master/lib/pinf-loader-js/adapter) are complete*):
    
        commonjs --platform node https://github.com/pinf/test-programs-js/zipball/master URLFetcher
  
  * Server + Browser Canvas Graphics with plain JavaScript library dependency. See [./CanvasGraphics](https://github.com/pinf/test-programs-js/tree/master/CanvasGraphics)
    
        commonjs --platform node --script serve https://github.com/pinf/test-programs-js/zipball/master --reloading --port 8081 CanvasGraphics


Automated Testing
=================

The programs in this project make a great test suite for the PINF JavaScript Loader, the loader's adapters and the platform
implementations. The following will run various programs against available and applicable platforms:

    # All tests
    commonjs --platform node --script test https://github.com/pinf/test-programs-js/zipball/master
    
    # Specific test
    commonjs --platform node --script test https://github.com/pinf/test-programs-js/zipball/master portable-HelloWorld.js


Development
===========

To make changes to a dependency and use your local copy when running the program, place the dependency's
package into `/pinf/workspaces/<UID>`. For example:

    cd /pinf/workspaces/github.com/pinf/
    git clone git://github.com/pinf/test-packages-js.git test-packages-js

The loader will automatically detect the package via its *UID* and use the local source.

If you have cloned this `test-programs-js` project and want to run it from source:

    cd /pinf/workspaces/github.com/pinf/
    git clone git://github.com/pinf/test-programs-js.git test-programs-js

Replace `https://github.com/pinf/test-programs-js/zipball/master` with `/pinf/workspaces/github.com/pinf/test-programs-js`
in the commands above.

  * Remove NPM dependency from CanvasGraphics example so we can make it portable.
  * Configurable `/pinf/pinf_packages` path.
  * Run exported programs on BravoJS or RequireJS.
  * `node` specific demos (with and without leveraging NPM)
  * `gpsee` specific demos
